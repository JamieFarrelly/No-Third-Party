# [No Third Party](https://jamiefarrelly.github.io/No-Third-Party/)

## The first and second party can be good fun. Third party? Not so much.

It's hard to keep track of what third parties can access on all of the sites that you use, and it doesn't help that most of these sites hide away the page that you need to go to in order to revoke third party access to your account. No Third Party has a list of all of the links you need for the likes of Google, Facebook etc.

The website was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jessysaurusrex/status/758671964542111744)

## Contribute

Feel free to add more sites to the list or even make the site better. The site was built using a one page bootstrap template which is also available on [Github](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-creative)

The site is hosted on Github itself, using GitHub Pages. You can see what it looks like [here](https://jamiefarrelly.github.io/No-Third-Party/).
